## About the Project
This is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Unlike the traditional 3x3 version, this game is scalable to an NxN grid, making it more challenging and fun. The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features
- Scalable game board (NxN grid size configurable).
- Dynamic grid creation based on user input.
- Player vs Player mode.
- Highlights the winning combination.
- Responsive design for seamless play on various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
    ```
    Right-click > Open With > Browser
    ```

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Input the grid size (e.g., 3 for 3x3, 4 for 4x4, etc.) and start the game.
3. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks ("X" or "O").
4. The game detects a winner or a draw automatically:
    - A player wins by aligning their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
    - The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
5. Restart the grid for a new game.

## Future Improvements
- Add Player vs Computer mode with AI.
- Include customizable themes.
- Save game progress and statistics.
- Online multiplayer functionality.
